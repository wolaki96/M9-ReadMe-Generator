# ReadMe Generator

 
  
## Description
I made this project to create a professional ReadMe without having to look up a template every time I needed to create a readme file. This ReadMe generator solves the problem of taking precious time away from creating your other projects, but still allows time for a nice looking document to present your project. By creating this generator, I learned about the basics of working in node.js and exploring programming and developing outside of the browser.
